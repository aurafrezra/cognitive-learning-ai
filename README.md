# 🧠 Personalized Cognitive Learning AI

A cognitive learning companion that tracks how well you understand key concepts, how confident you are, and how quickly you respond — built to boost personalized learning and memory retention. Designed to mimic how human memory fades and reinforces concepts over time.

---

### 🔥 Features
- 🧠 Tracks concepts, answers, confidence, time taken, and timestamps
- 📊 Visualizes personalized learning data in a clean UI
- 🗂️ Saves responses per user (`user_data/<username>_responses.json`)
- 🌐 Live deployment on Render
- 💻 Built with Python, Streamlit
